## File Organization

## Public Models

The public models used in the experiments are defined in `exp_params.py` under a global variable called `PUBLIC_MODELS` which is a dictionary organized by the dataset name and the training scheme.

Most of the models are automatically downloaded and cached when they are first used.
Only a few models have to be downloaded manually where we provide a script at `scripts/download_pretrained.sh` to download them.

## Example Scripts

A full usage example is provided in `scripts/example_full.sh`. This script has five steps, training base model, training source model, generating transfer adversarial examples, re-training base model with the defense, and evaluating it against other transfer attacks. To run it, simply execute the following command (some parameters may need to be modified):

```bash
bash scripts/example_full.sh
```

A following script is also provided to run the full training process but rather than having to locally train source models (this script directly loads two which can be configured to load more public models as a proxy)

```bash
bash scripts/training_with_public_models.sh
```

### CIFAR-10

Standard training models:

- `chenyaofo-resnet20`
- `chenyaofo-vgg11-bn`: Need to use code from `huyvnphan` to set ReLU in-place=False so we can run NAAttack. Seems to create attacks with an unusually high ASR.
